/**
 * This package includes patches that replace the vanilla hopper code almost completely. Metadata about inventories is
 * stored in their stack lists, hopper cache various frequently used information and several update propagation systems
 * and modification counter comparisons make sure that no outdated cached information is used while avoiding quadratic
 * runtime.
 * <p>
 * TODO: This section can be expended to include a lot more details. The README.md in this package includes a detailed description.
