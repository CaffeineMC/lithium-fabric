/**
 * Many of the column and row key arrays in block state tables will be duplicated, leading to an unnecessary waste of
 * memory. Since we have very limited options for trying to construct more optimized table types without throwing
 * maintainability or mod compatibility out the window, this class acts as a dirty way to find and de-duplicate arrays
 * after we construct our table types.
 * <p>
 * While this global cache does not provide the ability to remove or clear entries from it, the reality is that it
 * shouldn't matter because block state tables are only initialized once and remain loaded for the entire lifetime of
 * the game. Even in the event of classloader pre-boot shenanigans, we still shouldn't leak memory as our cache will be
 * dropped along with the rest of the loaded classes when the class loader is reaped.
