Lithium is a free and open-source Minecraft mod which works to optimize many areas of the game in order to provide
better overall performance. It works on both the **client and server**, and **doesn't require the mod to be installed
on both sides**.

### What makes Lithium different?

One of the most important design goals in Lithium is *correctness*. Unlike other mods which apply optimizations to the
game, Lithium does not sacrifice vanilla functionality or behavior in the name of raw speed. It's a no compromises
solution for those wanting to speed up their game, and as such, installing Lithium should be completely transparent
to the player.

If you do encounter an issue where Lithium deviates from the norm, please don't hesitate to
[open an issue.](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/issues) Each patch is carefully checked to ensure
vanilla parity, but after all, bugs are unavoidable. Before opening a new issue, please check using the search tool that your issue has not already been created, and that if
there is a suitable template for the issue you are opening, that it is filled out entirely. Issues which are duplicates
or do not contain the necessary information to triage and debug may be closed.

## Installation

### Manual installation (recommended)

You will need Fabric Loader installed in your game in order to load Lithium. If you haven't installed Fabric mods
before, you can find a variety of community guides for doing so [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install).

#### Stable releases

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric.svg)

The latest releases of Lithium are published to our [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and
[GitHub release](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/releases) pages. Releases are considered by our team to be
**suitable for general use**, but they are not guaranteed to be free of bugs and other issues.

Usually, releases will be made available on GitHub slightly sooner than other locations.

#### Bleeding-edge builds (unstable)

[![GitHub build status](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

If you are a player who is looking to get your hands on the latest **bleeding-edge changes for testing**, consider
taking a look at the automated builds produced through
our [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml?query=event%3Apush)
. This workflow automatically runs every time a change is pushed to the repository, and as such, the builds it produces
will generally reflect the latest snapshot of development.

Bleeding edge builds will often include unfinished code that hasn't been extensively tested. That code may introduce
incomplete features, bugs, crashes, and all other kinds of weird issues. You **should not use these bleeding edge builds**
unless you know what you are doing and are comfortable with software debugging. If you report issues using these builds,
we will expect that this is the case. Caveat emptor.

### CurseForge

[![CurseForge downloads](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_360438_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium)

If you are using the CurseForge client, you can continue to find downloads through our
[CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium). Unless you are using the CurseForge
client, you should prefer the downloads linked on our Modrinth or GitHub release pages above.

### Building from sources

Support is not provided for setting up build environments or compiling the mod. We ask that
users who are looking to get their hands dirty with the code have a basic understanding of compiling Java/Gradle
projects. The basic overview is provided here for those familiar.

#### Requirements

- JDK 17
    - You can either install this through a package manager such as [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows
      or [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) on other platforms. If you'd prefer to not use a package manager, you can always
      grab the installers or packages directly from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/).
- Gradle 7 or newer (optional)
    - The [Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:using_wrapper) is provided
      in this repository can be used instead of installing a suitable version of Gradle yourself. However, if you are
      building many projects, you may prefer to install it yourself through a suitable package manager as to save disk
      space and to avoid many Gradle daemons sitting around in memory.

#### Building with Gradle

Lithium uses a typical Gradle project structure and can be built by simply running the default `build` task. After Gradle
finishes building the project, you can find the build artifacts (typical mod binaries, and their sources) in
`build/libs`.

**Tip:** If this is a one-off build, and you would prefer the Gradle daemon does not stick around in memory afterwards,
try adding the [`--no-daemon` flag](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon)
to ensure that the daemon is torn down after the build is complete. However, subsequent builds of the project will
[start more slowly](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:why_the_daemon) if the Gradle
daemon is not available to be re-used.

Build artifacts ending in `api` are for developers compiling against Lithium's API.

### Configuration

Out of the box, no additional configuration is necessary once the mod has been installed. Lithium makes use of a
configuration override system which allows you to either forcefully disable problematic patches or enable incubating
patches which are otherwise disabled by default. As such, an empty config file simply means you'd like to use the
default configuration, which includes all stable optimizations by default.

See [the Wiki page](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on the configuration file
format and all available options. The wiki may be outdated.
